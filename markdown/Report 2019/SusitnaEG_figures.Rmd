The heavy dashed line is the Ricker relationship constructed from ln($\alpha\prime$) and $\beta$ posterior medians. Ricker relationships are also plotted (light grey lines) for 40 paired values of ln($\alpha\prime$) and $\beta$ sampled from the posterior probability distribution, representing plausible Ricker relationships that could have generated the observed data.
