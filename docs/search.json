    "text": "Outdated Escapement estimates\nFor the moment we have decided to only distribute the latest year each time the model is run, but monitor changes in prior years estimates. Relative to the 2023 estimates the changes for most stocks and years are modest (Generally less than 5% and always less than 9%). Addition of the Lake Creek sonar data continues to put upward pressure on the Yentna escapement when compared to the aerial survey data resulting in increased estimates of Lake Creek’s contribution to the Yentna escapement.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Previously released annual escapement estimates for the Susitna River Chinook salmon stock groups obtained by fitting a state-space model to data from 1979 to 2022.
