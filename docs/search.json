    "section": "Outdated Escapement estimates",
    "text": "Outdated Escapement estimates\nFor the moment we have decided to only distribute the latest year each time the model is run, but monitor changes in prior years estimates. The changes for most stocks are small although there are substantial changes to the 2021 and 2022 Yentna estimates. The 2021 change actually moves back towards the original 2021 estimate (18,962). The 2022 change is troubling because the empirical data we have (Lake creek sonar) was revised upwards. Both changes are driven by instability in our estimates of stock composition in the Yentna drainage. So far both sonar counts we have collected have put upwards pressure on the Yentna escapement estimate when compared to the aerial survey data we have for the same years. Because the sonar estimate is considerably more precise the model has adjusted the Lake Creek stock composition estimate upwards to reduce the tension between the sonar and survey data. I think these changes will stabilize once we add more sonar data but I also think we should look at the stock composition parameterization next time the model is revised. That said the 2022 Yentna estimate is particularly unstable because Talachulitna was not flown. Recall Yentna has 2 surveys which track abundance well (Lake and Talachulitna) and 2 surveys that track abundance poorly (Cache and Peters). You can see that in the graph above and the model also estimates lower survey error for Lake and Talachulitna.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Previously released annual escapement estimates for the Susitna River Chinook salmon stock groups obtained by fitting a state-space model to data from 1979 to 2022.
